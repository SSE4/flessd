What is FLESSD?

   FLESSD is a free reimplementation of FMOD (http://www.fmod.org/), a very
commonly used music playing and sound effects library. Unfortunately FMOD is
not free, and its author is extremely reluctant to opensourcing it. Moreover,
it only supports a limited number of platforms. FLESSD aims to fix these two
problems.


Is FLESSD reimplemented from scratch?

   Yes and no. The only similarity between FMOD and FLESSD is the interface
(ie. the header file). Hoewever, I did not write everything from scratch:
FLESSD makes extensive use of the SDL_mixer and SDL_audio libraries.


Will FLESSD be any better than FMOD?

   Though it may happen accidentally, I do not really plan to improve on
performances. The FMOD author claims to have the best audio engine available
on each platform, and this will probably remain the case for platforms that
are supported by FMOD. However this is simply not true because FMOD only
supports a handful of platforms; no BeOS, no BSD Unix, no QNX, and so on. If
you need -real- portability, you will want FLESSD. If you want freedom, you
will want FLESSD. Otherwise, you will probably just stick with FMOD, which is
technically very good..
